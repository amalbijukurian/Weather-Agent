‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Agent: Webhook-Triggered Current Weather API
This project is an n8n workflow designed to serve as a fast, external API for weather data.
It's a quick, three-step agent: it takes a city name via a webhook, queries the current weather from WeatherAPI.com, and instantly returns a clean JSON response. This is perfect for integrating weather data into chat bots, custom applications, or dashboards.
‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Steps
Webhook: Receives an incoming GET or POST request, reading the target city from the URL's query parameter (?city=...).
HTTP Request: Calls the WeatherAPI.com, injecting the requested city into the URL.
Respond to Webhook: Extracts key information (city, temperature, condition) from the API result and sends a structured JSON response back to the original caller.
üöÄ Setup & Usage
1. Import and Secure
Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.
Security Warning: In the HTTP Request node, you must replace the hard-coded API key with your own personal WeatherAPI.com key. It's highly recommended to store your key securely using an n8n Credential.
Activate the workflow.
2. Make an API Call
The agent is now live at the Webhook URL (e.g., [Your_n8n_URL]/webhook/weather).
Example Request (using curl):
# Replace [Your_Webhook_URL] with the full URL copied from your Webhook node
curl -X GET "[Your_Webhook_URL]/weather?city=New+York"


Example Response:
{
  "city": "New York",
  "temperature": "22.5",
  "condition": "Sunny"
}
