# **‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Agent: Webhook-Triggered Current Weather API**

This project is an **n8n workflow** designed to serve as a fast, external API for weather data.

It's a quick, three-step agent: it takes a city name via a **webhook**, queries the current weather from **WeatherAPI.com**, and instantly returns a clean JSON response. This is perfect for integrating weather data into chat bots, custom applications, or dashboards.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Steps**

1. **Webhook:** Receives an incoming GET or POST request, reading the target city from the URL's query parameter (?city=...).  
2. **HTTP Request:** Calls the WeatherAPI.com, injecting the requested city into the URL.  
3. **Respond to Webhook:** Extracts key information (city, temperature, condition) from the API result and sends a structured JSON response back to the original caller.

## **üöÄ Setup & Usage**

### **1\. Import and Secure**

1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.  
2. **Security Warning:** In the **HTTP Request** node, you **must** replace the hard-coded API key with your own personal WeatherAPI.com key. It's highly recommended to store your key securely using an **n8n Credential**.  
3. **Activate** the workflow.

### **2\. Make an API Call**

The agent is now live at the Webhook URL (e.g., \[Your\_n8n\_URL\]/webhook/weather).

**Example Request (using curl):**

\# Replace \[Your\_Webhook\_URL\] with the full URL copied from your Webhook node  
curl \-X GET "\[Your\_Webhook\_URL\]/weather?city=New+York"

**Example Response:**

{  
  "city": "New York",  
  "temperature": "22.5",  
  "condition": "Sunny"  
}
